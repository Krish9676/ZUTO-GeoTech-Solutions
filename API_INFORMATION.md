## 🌟 What is This API?

Imagine you have a **magic camera** that can look at a sick plant and tell you exactly what's wrong with it! 🧙‍♂️📸

**That's exactly what our API does!**

- **Input**: A photo of a plant leaf
- **Output**: "This plant has tomato blight disease with 85% confidence"
- **Bonus**: It also gives you advice on how to fix it!

**Real Example:**
- Farmer takes a photo of a tomato leaf with brown spots
- API analyzes the image and says: "Tomato blight disease, 92% sure"
- API gives advice: "Remove infected leaves and apply fungicide"

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

Think of our API like a **smart factory** that processes plant photos:

```
📸 Photo Input → 🧠 AI Brain → 📊 Analysis → 💾 Save Results → 📱 Send Answer
```

**The Factory Workers:**
1. **Receptionist** (API endpoints) - Receives photos and requests
2. **Image Processor** (image_utils.py) - Prepares photos for the AI
3. **AI Brain** (inference.py) - Analyzes photos using a trained model
4. **Database Clerk** (Supabase) - Saves all the results
5. **Storage Manager** (Supabase Storage) - Keeps photos safe
6. **Advisor** (LLaMA integration) - Gives plant care advice

## 📁 How Each File Works

### **1. `api/app/main.py` - The Front Door 🚪**
```python
# This is like the main entrance to our building
app = FastAPI(title="Crop Disease Detection API")

# These are like security guards that check who's coming in
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["*"])

# This is like a reception desk
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"status": "ok", "message": "API is running"}

# This is like a quick health check
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

**What it does:**
- Creates the main API application
- Sets up security rules
- Provides health check endpoints
- Connects all the other parts

### **2. `api/app/api.py` - The Main Office 🏢**
```python
# This is where all the main work happens
@router.post("/upload")
async def upload_image(file: UploadFile, crop_name: str):
    # 1. Get the photo from the user
    # 2. Process the photo
    # 3. Ask the AI to analyze it
    # 4. Save the results
    # 5. Send back the answer
```

**What it does:**
- Receives photo uploads from users
- Coordinates the entire process
- Saves results to database
- Sends back the diagnosis

### **3. `api/app/inference.py` - The AI Brain 🧠**
```python
# This is where the magic happens!
def run_inference(image_tensor):
    # 1. Load the AI model (but only when needed!)
    session = load_model()
    
    # 2. Ask the AI to analyze the photo
    outputs = session.run(None, {input_name: image_tensor})
    
    # 3. Convert AI's answer to something humans understand
    scores = outputs[0][0]
    probabilities = softmax(scores)  # Convert to percentages
    
    # 4. Get the best guess and how sure the AI is
    predicted_class_idx = np.argmax(probabilities)
    confidence = float(probabilities[predicted_class_idx] * 100)
    
    return {"label": label, "confidence": confidence}
```

**What it does:**
- Loads the AI model (lazy loading - only when needed)
- Runs the AI analysis on plant photos
- Converts AI numbers to human-readable answers
- Calculates how confident the AI is

**Key Concept - Lazy Loading:**
- **Before**: Model loads when API starts (slow startup)
- **After**: Model loads only when first photo is analyzed (fast startup)

### **4. `api/app/utils/image_utils.py` - The Photo Lab 📸**
```python
# This is like a photo editing studio
preprocess_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),      # Make photo bigger
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),  # Cut to exact size
    transforms.ToTensor(),        # Convert to AI format
    transforms.Normalize(        # Adjust colors like AI expects
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    ),
])

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # 1. Open the photo
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    
    # 2. Apply all the transformations
    image_tensor = preprocess_transforms(image)
    
    return image_tensor
```

**What it does:**
- Opens plant photos
- Resizes them to the right size (224x224 pixels)
- Adjusts colors to what the AI expects
- Converts photos to the format the AI can understand

**Why 224x224 pixels?**
- MobileNet (our AI model) was trained on 224x224 pixel images
- It's like teaching someone to read - they need the text to be the right size!

### **5. `api/app/utils/heatmap.py` - The X-Ray Machine 🔍**
```python
# This creates a "heat map" showing where the AI is looking
def generate_heatmap(image_path, image_tensor, prediction_results):
    # 1. Take the original photo
    # 2. Show which parts the AI thinks are important
    # 3. Create a new image with red/yellow highlights
    # 4. Save the heatmap
```

**What it does:**
- Creates visual explanations of AI decisions
- Shows which parts of the leaf the AI focused on
- Helps farmers understand why the AI made its diagnosis

**Example:**
- AI says: "This leaf has blight disease"
- Heatmap shows: Red areas on the brown spots
- Farmer thinks: "Ah, the AI is looking at the right spots!"

### **6. `api/app/utils/supabase_client.py` - The Database Helper 🤝**
```python
# This helps us talk to the database
def create_supabase_client():
    supabase_url = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
    supabase_key = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
    
    return create_client(supabase_url, supabase_key)
```

**What it does:**
- Connects to the Supabase database
- Handles all database operations
- Makes sure we're using the right credentials

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Code 📦**
```bash
# Make sure all your code is saved
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Hosting Service 🏠**
We chose **Render** because:
- Free tier available
- Easy to use
- Good for Python APIs
- Automatic deployments

### **Step 3: Configure Render (render.yaml) ⚙️**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: crop-disease-detection-api
    env: python
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: |
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: python run.py
    healthCheckPath: /health  # Important for avoiding timeouts!
```

**What each part means:**
- `type: web`: This is a web service (not a background job)
- `name`: What we'll call our API
- `env: python`: Use Python environment
- `plan: starter`: Use the free plan
- `buildCommand`: What to do to prepare the code
- `startCommand`: How to start the API
- `healthCheckPath`: Where Render checks if API is working

### **Step 4: Set Environment Variables 🔑**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_service_role_key
STORAGE_BUCKET=crop-images
```

**Why these are important:**
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Where to find your database
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: The password to access your database
- `STORAGE_BUCKET`: Where to store plant photos

### **Step 5: Deploy! 🚀**
1. Connect your GitHub to Render
2. Render automatically detects your code
3. Render builds and deploys your API
4. Your API goes live on the internet!

## 🧪 Testing and Troubleshooting

### **Common Problems and Solutions:**

#### **Problem 1: Model Not Found ❌**
```
Error: Model file not found: models/mobilenet.onnx
```

**Solution:**
- Check if the model file exists in the right folder
- Make sure the path is correct
- Use our improved path resolution system

#### **Problem 2: Database Connection Failed ❌**
```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy
```

**Solution:**
- Use the service role key (not anon key)
- Check if the detections table exists
- Verify database permissions

#### **Problem 3: Deployment Timeout ❌**
```
==> Timed Out
```

**Solution:**
- Add health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
- Use lazy loading for the model
- Configure proper health check paths in render.yaml

### **Testing Your API:**
```bash
# Test health check
curl https://your-api.onrender.com/health

# Test image upload
curl -X POST https://your-api.onrender.com/api/upload \
  -F "file=@plant_photo.jpg" \
  -F "crop_name=tomato"
```
