## üèóÔ∏è Build for Production

### Android Build

#### 1. Generate Keystore
```bash
# Create keystore for signing
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

#### 2. Configure Signing
Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=<password from previous step>
keyPassword=<password from previous step>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<path to keystore file>
```

#### 3. Update build.gradle
The `android/app/build.gradle` should include:
```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Build APK
```bash
# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS Build (macOS only)

#### 1. Configure Xcode
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Set your team and bundle identifier
3. Configure signing & capabilities

#### 2. Build iOS App
```bash
# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Build IPA for App Store
flutter build ipa --release
```
