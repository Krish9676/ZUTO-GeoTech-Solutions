      "diagnosis": "Your wheat crop is affected by Powdery Mildew, as evidenced by the white, powdery fungal growth on the leaf surface. This disease can reduce photosynthesis and yield if it spreads to the flag leaf and head. For control, apply a fungicide containing a triazole (like tebuconazole) or a strobilurin (like azoxystrobin). The disease is favored by dense canopies, so consider reducing nitrogen rates in future plantings if this is a recurring problem.",
