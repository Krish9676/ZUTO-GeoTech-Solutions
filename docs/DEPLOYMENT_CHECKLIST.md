- [ ] Configure `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (if using LLM)
- [ ] Set `LOG_LEVEL=info` for production

### 2. Security Configuration
- [ ] Update CORS settings for production domain
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add API authentication (if needed)
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up firewall rules

### 3. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement request logging

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Set up health checks
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up alerting

### 5. Database and Storage
- [ ] Verify Supabase tables created
- [ ] Test storage bucket permissions
- [ ] Configure backup strategy
